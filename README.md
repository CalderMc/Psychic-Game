NFL based hangman game. Think you know your football teams and phrases? Take the challenge!

This game was absolutely fun to create because I love football so much. Setting the array was easy, the terms were fun to create, but the flow of the game and especially the conclusion were difficult for me. The wrong images or both images kept appearing at the end of the game, for example. I had to figure out what was being called when and why the display wasn't updating the way I wanted it to. Obviously my code needed adjustments and I am thrilled with the results.
